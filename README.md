### Version 1 Release To-Dos:

* ~~git add~~
* ~~git commit -m "message"~~
* ~~git checkout [-- | -b]~~
* ~~git branch [-d] <branch_name>~~
* ~~"console" like interface~~
* ~~Real time commit graph display~~

### Ice Box (Prioritized)

1. Keep to state the available files per branch
2. git rm
3. git rebase
